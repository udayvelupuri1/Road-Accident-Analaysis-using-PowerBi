# Road Accident Analysis using Power BI

## Overview

This project analyzes road accident data using Microsoft Power BI, providing valuable insights into accident trends, contributing factors, and potential areas for intervention. The analysis incorporates data cleaning, processing, modeling, and visualization to create an interactive and informative dashboard.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Ensures the data is accurate and free from inconsistencies to maintain the integrity of the analysis.
- **Data Processing:** Prepares the data for effective modeling and visualization.
- **Data Modeling:** Structures the data for creating meaningful relationships and analysis.
- **Background Design:** Utilizes PowerPoint to design visually appealing backgrounds for the dashboards.
- **Data Visualization:** Leverages Power BI's charting and visualization capabilities to present insights effectively.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI:** For data visualization and interactive dashboards.
- **PowerPoint:** For designing custom backgrounds.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Import the road accident dataset.
   - Clean and process the data to address missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
2. **Data Modeling:**
   - Define relationships between datasets.
   - Create calculated fields and measures for deeper insights.
3. **Dashboard Creation:**
   - Design backgrounds using PowerPoint and import them into Power BI.
   - Create charts, maps, and other visualizations.
   - Integrate slicers and filters for interactivity.
4. **Insights Generation:**
   - Use the dashboard to explore accident trends and derive actionable insights.

## Insights and Outcomes

- Identify high-risk areas and times for road accidents.
- Understand key contributing factors like weather, vehicle types, and human behavior.
- Provide recommendations to improve road safety.
